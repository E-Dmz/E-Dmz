### Hi there 👋

- I'm a science teacher in Paris with a research background 💡🔬 in neuroscience 🧠 and biochemistry 🧬. 

- 🌱 I'm a self-taught pythonista, i do love code and i'm currently learning ML/DL tools and JS. I'd like to learn React and D3js in the near future.

- 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ I'd like to collaborate with you on some kick-ass project! 💬 You can follow/reach me on Twitter @E_Dmz and @E_Dmz_Bot.

- My Github repos contain scripts that automate tasks or help understanding "how it all works":

  - 📈 #dataviz suite:
    * ![DisplayDataCovid: Tweets a dataviz of Covid-19 in France](https://github.com/E-Dmz/DisplayDataCovid)

  - 🐦 #twitterapi suite:
    * ![ThreadFromATextFileScript: Tweets a thread from a simple text file (very useful)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/ThreadFromATextFileScript)
    * ![SelfTweetingScript: A script that tweets itself when executed (absolutely useless)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/SelfTweetingScript)
    * ![PingPong: Replies automatically "pong" when you're mentionned in a tweet that contains "ping" (even more useless)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PingPong)
    * ![WakeUp: Politely greets your followers in the morning](https://github.com/E-Dmz/WakeUp)
  
  - 💡 #miscellaneous:
    * ![PiPoem: A piece of code showing that a simple 4-verse poem (in French) can provide you with a most precise approximation of pi](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PiPoem)
