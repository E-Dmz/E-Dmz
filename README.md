### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a science teacher in Paris with a research background in neuroscience and biochemistry. I'm also a self-taught pythonista and I'm currently learning ML/DL tools, C, JS, React and D3js.

I'm open to remarks and collaboration! Please reach me on twitter @E_Dmz or @E_Dmz_Bot.

I'm having a lot of fun coding and developing little apps that can be helpful or just interesting.

My twitter suite includes:
* ![How to publish a thread from a simple text file](https://github.com/E-Dmz/ThreadFromATextFileScript)
* ![How to write a script that publishes itself when executed](https://github.com/E-Dmz/SelfTweetingScript)
* ![How to reply automatically "pong" when a tweet that contains "ping" is mentioning you](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PingPong)
* ![How to politely greet your followers in the morning](https://github.com/E-Dmz/WakeUp)

My data analysis suite includes:
* ![A daily graph representation of Covid data in France](https://github.com/E-Dmz/DisplayDataCovid)

My miscellaneous suite includes:
* ![A piece of code that shows how a simple 4-verse poem (in French) can provide you with a most precise approximation of pi](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PiPoem)
