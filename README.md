### Hi there 👋

- I'm 37 and I live in Paris. 
- I spent 10y studying and doing research in 🧬💊🧠 (biochemistry, pharmacology and neuroscience).
- I spent another 10y teaching science and techniques to 👨‍🎓👷‍♀️👨‍⚕️ (high-school students, water treatment technicians and radiology technicians). 
- I'm passionate about 💡🔧🧮 (learning, designing new tools and automating tasks)
- I'm training as a data scientist and I recently completed the Data Science track of Le Wagon 
- 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ I'd like to collaborate with you on some kick-ass project! 💬 You can reach me on Twitter @E_Dmz and on LinkedIn

- Final project at Le Wagon [->link<-](https://github.com/antifakescience)

- My Github repos (currently poorly maintained, as of November 2021) contain scripts that automate tasks or help understanding "how it all works":

  - 📈 #dataviz suite:
    * ![DisplayDataCovid: Tweets a dataviz of Covid-19 in France](https://github.com/E-Dmz/DisplayDataCovid)

  - 🐦 #twitterapi suite:
    * ![ThreadFromATextFileScript: Tweets a thread from a simple text file (very useful)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/ThreadFromATextFileScript)
    * ![SelfTweetingScript: A script that tweets itself when executed (absolutely useless)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/SelfTweetingScript)
    * ![PingPong: Replies automatically "pong" when you're mentionned in a tweet that contains "ping" (even more useless)](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PingPong)
    * ![WakeUp: Politely greets your followers in the morning](https://github.com/E-Dmz/WakeUp)
  
  - 💡 #miscellaneous:
    * ![PiPoem: A piece of code showing that a simple 4-verse poem (in French) can provide you with a most precise approximation of pi](https://github.com/E-Dmz/PiPoem)
